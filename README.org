* linux-mba: Linux Kernel for MacBook{Air8.x,Pro15.y} with =systemd= setup (Arch, Debian, Ubuntu etc.)

To fetch and compile the Linux kernel sources and additional =bce= and =applespi= modules, just call =make=.

To install the artifacts just call =sudo make install=.

The Linux kernel image =vmlinuz-linux= and =initramfs-linux.img= file are located after the install 
at the path =/boot/linux-mba= and all the compiled Linux kernel modules at the path =/lib/modules/5.1.5-mba+/=.

If you want to use the suggested =systemd= integration in this repository e.g. to automatically reload the needed 
WLAN (WiFi) driver just update the =systemd= environment by calling =make systemd=.
